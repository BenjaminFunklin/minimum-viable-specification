<p>If you’ve never read about the Abilene Paradox, go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox">read about
it</a>. (Or if you have a bit more
time, read <a href="http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Abilene-Paradox_The-Management-of-Agreement.htm_.pdf">the original
article</a>.)
The basic idea is that many times groups or organizations make decisions,
thinking that they are working collaboratively, and deliver an outcome none of
the participants wanted. The process of making that decision results in missed
expectations and projects that are a disappointment. The real output here is
wasted effort and frustration.</p>

<p>What if there were a Minimum Viable Specification?</p>

<p>What would be in it? Who would write it? And how would you measure that it was
any better than the failed processes and decisions we make today?</p>

<p><strong>What is a Minimum Viable Specification?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> The clearest path to what you need to do to get to done.</li>
<li> Small enough to declare a single problem and solution in about 15 minutes, but
not smaller.</li>
<li> Big enough to avoid writing a specification for every idea.</li>
<li> A name we all use to describe the idea.</li>
<li> A description of the problem statement, the assumptions we’re making, and why we
are doing this thing.</li>
<li> A statement of the outputs we expect from this specification.</li>
<li> The way we will measure how things are going and how often.</li>
<li> How we propose to expend time, cost, and effort to do it and consequently, when
we think it will be done.</li>
<li> A place we are able to discuss how things are going.</li>
<li> A Parking Lot for the ideas we generate that don’t matter right now.</li>
</ol>
