  "body": "### Creating a Minimum Viable Specification\r\n\r\nIf you’ve never read about the Abilene Paradox, go [read about\r\nit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox). (Or if you have a bit more\r\ntime, read [the original\r\narticle](http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Abilene-Paradox_The-Management-of-Agreement.htm_.pdf).)\r\nThe basic idea is that many times groups or organizations make decisions,\r\nthinking that they are working collaboratively, and deliver an outcome none of\r\nthe participants wanted. The process of making that decision results in missed\r\nexpectations and projects that are a disappointment. The real output here is\r\nwasted effort and frustration.\r\n\r\n### **Fixing with The Smallest Change Possible**\r\n\r\nWhat if there were a Minimum Viable Specification?\r\n\r\nWhat would be in it? Who would write it? And how would you measure that it was\r\nany better than the failed processes and decisions we make today?\r\n\r\n#### A Suggestion\r\n\r\n**What is a Minimum Viable Specification?**\r\n\r\n1.  The clearest path to what you need to do to get to done.\r\n1.  Small enough to declare a single problem and solution in about 15 minutes, but\r\nnot smaller.\r\n1.  Big enough to avoid writing a specification for every idea.\r\n1.  A name we all use to describe the idea.\r\n1.  A description of the problem statement, the assumptions we’re making, and why we\r\nare doing this thing.\r\n1.  A statement of the outputs we expect from this specification.\r\n1.  The way we will measure how things are going and how often.\r\n1.  How we propose to expend time, cost, and effort to do it and consequently, when\r\nwe think it will be done.\r\n1.  A place we are able to discuss how things are going.\r\n1.  A Parking Lot for the ideas we generate that don’t matter right now.\r\n\r\n[See an example template](http://bit.ly/minimumviablespec).\r\n\r\n## How do I help?\r\n1. contribute to the project, either by suggesting a change or\r\n1. by providing examples\r\n1. use the template or some similar templates, and make specs better.\r\n",
