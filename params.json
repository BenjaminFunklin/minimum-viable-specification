If it’s not clear, do your best.\r\n\r\n## Assumptions\r\n\r\n1. A few assumptions that led us here\r\n\r\n2. A few more, but not too many\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\n\r\nWe will declare success when this happens, as quantified by the outputs, the realization of the benefit, and the metrics we track.\r\n\r\n## Outputs\r\n\r\n1. These are a few outcomes we want to achieve\r\n\r\n2. And a few more...\r\n\r\n## Benefit\r\n\r\n* These are the stated benefits of our outcomes\r\n\r\n* And a few more...\r\n\r\n# How will we do it\r\n\r\nHere is our best-effort description of how we will do this thing as of [today’s date]\r\n\r\n## What could go wrong\r\n\r\n* These are a few potential risks to our approach\r\n\r\n* And a few more...\r\n\r\n## Metrics\r\n\r\nWe will measure our progress with these metrics:\r\n\r\n1. Metric x, checked on y date, with method z\r\n\r\n2. Metric x, checked on y date, with method z\r\n\r\n## Time, Cost, and Effort\r\n\r\nHow much time will it take, what will it cost, and how are you estimating this effort?\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n\r\nA place for us to put our notes about the discussions we have on this project.\r\n\r\n# Parking Lot\r\n\r\nA place for us to list all of the great ideas we get that are not immediately relevant to this project.\r\n\r\n# What is this document?\r\n\r\n**What is a Minimum Viable Specification?**\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do to get to done.\r\n\r\n**What version of this document am I looking at?**\r\n\r\nv1.0, last updated 6/4/2016\r\n\r\n**How long should it take me to fill this out?**\r\n\r\nYou should be able to fill out the key points of a Minimum Viable Specification in 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n**What should I do if I want to get more involved?**\r\n\r\nGo to [http://minimumviablespec.com](http://minimumviablespec.com)\r\n\r\n",
